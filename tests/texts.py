Alice = \
"CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole\n" \
"\n" \
"Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\n" \
"bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the\n" \
"book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in\n" \
"it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or\n" \
"conversation?'\n" \
"\n" \
"So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\n" \
"hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure\n" \
"of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n" \
"picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\n" \
"close by her.\n" \
"\n" \
"There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so\n" \
"VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!\n" \
"Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it\n" \
"occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time\n" \
"it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH\n" \
"OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,\n" \
"Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had\n" \
"never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch\n" \
"to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field\n" \
"after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large\n" \
"rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n" \
"\n" \
"In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\n" \
"in the world she was to get out again.\n" \
"\n" \
"The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\n" \
"dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\n" \
"about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep\n" \
"well.\n" \
"\n" \
"Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\n" \
"plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was\n" \
"going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what\n" \
"she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\n" \
"looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\n" \
"cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\n" \
"hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as\n" \
"she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great\n" \
"disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\n" \
"of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as\n" \
"she fell past it.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall\n" \
"think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at\n" \
"home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top\n" \
"of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)\n" \
"\n" \
"Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how\n" \
"many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting\n" \
"somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four\n" \
"thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several\n" \
"things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this\n" \
"was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there\n" \
"was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)\n" \
"'--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\n" \
"or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or\n" \
"Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n" \
"\n" \
"Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the\n" \
"earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with\n" \
"their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad\n" \
"there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the\n" \
"right word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country\n" \
"is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and\n" \
"she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\n" \
"through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an\n" \
"ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to\n" \
"ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\n" \
"\n" \
"Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\n" \
"talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'\n" \
"(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at\n" \
"tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no\n" \
"mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very\n" \
"like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice\n" \
"began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy\n" \
"sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do\n" \
"bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,\n" \
"it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing\n" \
"off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with\n" \
"Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:\n" \
"did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon\n" \
"a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n" \
"\n" \
"Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\n" \
"she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\n" \
"long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.\n" \
"There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and\n" \
"was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears\n" \
"and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she\n" \
"turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\n" \
"herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\n" \
"from the roof.\n" \
"\n" \
"There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\n" \
"Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\n" \
"door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\n" \
"get out again.\n" \
"\n" \
"Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\n" \
"glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's\n" \
"first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\n" \
"but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\n" \
"but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\n" \
"time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\n" \
"behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\n" \
"little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n" \
"\n" \
"Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n" \
"much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\n" \
"into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\n" \
"that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\n" \
"those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\n" \
"doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it\n" \
"would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could\n" \
"shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.'\n" \
"For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,\n" \
"that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really\n" \
"impossible.\n" \
"\n" \
"There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\n" \
"back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\n" \
"any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\n" \
"time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here\n" \
"before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\n" \
"label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large\n" \
"letters.\n" \
"\n" \
"It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was\n" \
"not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and\n" \
"see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read several nice\n" \
"little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild\n" \
"beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember\n" \
"the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot\n" \
"poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\n" \
"finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never\n" \
"forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is\n" \
"almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\n" \
"\n" \
"However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste\n" \
"it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour\n" \
"of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot\n" \
"buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n" \
"\n" \
"  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n" \
"\n" \
"    *    *    *    *    *    *\n" \
"\n" \
"  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n" \
"\n" \
"'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a\n" \
"telescope.'\n" \
"\n" \
"And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\n" \
"brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\n" \
"through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\n" \
"waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\n" \
"she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said\n" \
"Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder\n" \
"what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a\n" \
"candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\n" \
"ever having seen such a thing.\n" \
"\n" \
"After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\n" \
"into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\n" \
"door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\n" \
"went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\n" \
"it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\n" \
"best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\n" \
"and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\n" \
"sat down and cried.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself,\n" \
"rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally\n" \
"gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\n" \
"and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\n" \
"her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\n" \
"cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\n" \
"for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n" \
"'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!\n" \
"Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'\n" \
"\n" \
"Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\n" \
"she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n" \
"'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said\n" \
"Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\n" \
"makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll\n" \
"get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'\n" \
"\n" \
"She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which\n" \
"way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\n" \
"growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\n" \
"size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\n" \
"had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\n" \
"things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on\n" \
"in the common way.\n" \
"\n" \
"So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n" \
"\n" \
"  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n" \
"\n" \
"    *    *    *    *    *    *\n" \
"\n" \

"\n" \
"CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears\n" \
"\n" \
"'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\n" \
"for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm\n" \
"opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'\n" \
"(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\n" \
"sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder\n" \
"who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure\n" \
"_I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\n" \
"myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be\n" \
"kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want\n" \
"to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'\n" \
"\n" \
"And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must\n" \
"go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending\n" \
"presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n" \
"\n" \
"     ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\n" \
"       HEARTHRUG,\n" \
"         NEAR THE FENDER,\n" \
"           (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).\n" \
"\n" \
"Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'\n" \
"\n" \
"Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\n" \
"now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\n" \
"key and hurried off to the garden door.\n" \
"\n" \
"Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\n" \
"look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\n" \
"hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n" \
"\n" \
"'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like\n" \
"you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way! Stop this\n" \
"moment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of\n" \
"tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches\n" \
"deep and reaching half down the hall.\n" \
"\n" \
"After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\n" \
"she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\n" \
"Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in\n" \
"one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great\n" \
"hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!\n" \
"Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so\n" \
"desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\n" \
"came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--'\n" \
"The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,\n" \
"and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\n" \
"\n" \
"Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\n" \
"kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How\n" \
"queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\n" \
"I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\n" \
"same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a\n" \
"little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who\n" \
"in the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began thinking\n" \
"over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to\n" \
"see if she could have been changed for any of them.\n" \
"\n" \
"'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long\n" \
"ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't\n" \
"be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\n" \
"very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling\n" \
"it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me\n" \
"see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and\n" \
"four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!\n" \
"However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.\n" \
"London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and\n" \
"Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for\n" \
"Mabel! I'll try and say \"How doth the little--\"' and she crossed her\n" \
"hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,\n" \
"but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the\n" \
"same as they used to do:--\n" \
"\n" \
"     'How doth the little crocodile\n" \
"      Improve his shining tail,\n" \
"     And pour the waters of the Nile\n" \
"      On every golden scale!\n" \
"\n" \
"     'How cheerfully he seems to grin,\n" \
"      How neatly spread his claws,\n" \
"     And welcome little fishes in\n" \
"      With gently smiling jaws!'\n" \
"\n" \
"'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes\n" \
"filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and\n" \
"I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\n" \
"no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've\n" \
"made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no\n" \
"use their putting their heads down and saying \"Come up again, dear!\" I\n" \
"shall only look up and say \"Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then,\n" \
"if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here\n" \
"till I'm somebody else\"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst\n" \
"of tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired\n" \
"of being all alone here!'\n" \
"\n" \
"As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\n" \
"that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while\n" \
"she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must\n" \
"be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure\n" \
"herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now\n" \
"about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found\n" \
"out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped\n" \
"it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n" \
"\n" \
"'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\n" \
"sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and\n" \
"now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door:\n" \
"but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was\n" \
"lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'\n" \
"thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!\n" \
"And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'\n" \
"\n" \
"As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!\n" \
"she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she\n" \
"had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by\n" \
"railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\n" \
"her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\n" \
"to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\n" \
"sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\n" \
"of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon\n" \
"made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she\n" \
"was nine feet high.\n" \
"\n" \
"'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying\n" \
"to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\n" \
"being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!\n" \
"However, everything is queer to-day.'\n" \
"\n" \
"Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\n" \
"off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\n" \
"it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\n" \
"she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\n" \
"slipped in like herself.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?\n" \
"Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\n" \
"likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she\n" \
"began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\n" \
"of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right\n" \
"way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\n" \
"she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of\n" \
"a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather\n" \
"inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\n" \
"but it said nothing.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's\n" \
"a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all\n" \
"her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\n" \
"anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which\n" \
"was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\n" \
"sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.\n" \
"'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt\n" \
"the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'\n" \
"\n" \
"'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would\n" \
"YOU like cats if you were me?'\n" \
"\n" \
"'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry\n" \
"about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd\n" \
"take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet\n" \
"thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the\n" \
"pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and\n" \
"washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's\n" \
"such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried\n" \
"Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she\n" \
"felt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any\n" \
"more if you'd rather not.'\n" \
"\n" \
"'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\n" \
"tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED\n" \
"cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'\n" \
"\n" \
"'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\n" \
"conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not\n" \
"answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near\n" \
"our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\n" \
"know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when\n" \
"you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\n" \
"of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,\n" \
"you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He\n" \
"says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful\n" \
"tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming\n" \
"away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in\n" \
"the pool as it went.\n" \
"\n" \
"So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\n" \
"won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the\n" \
"Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its\n" \
"face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\n" \
"trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my\n" \
"history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\n" \
"\n" \
"It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\n" \
"birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,\n" \
"a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the\n" \
"way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\n"

"Mr. Sherlock Holmes\n" \
"\n" \
"\n" \
"\n" \
"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings,\n" \
"save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night,\n" \
"was seated at the breakfast table.  I stood upon the hearth-rug\n" \
"and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the\n" \
"night before.  It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed,\n" \
"of the sort which is known as a \"Penang lawyer.\"  Just under the\n" \
"head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across.  \"To James\n" \
"Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.,\" was engraved\n" \
"upon it, with the date \"1884.\"  It was just such a stick as the\n" \
"old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry--dignified, solid,\n" \
"and reassuring.\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no\n" \
"sign of my occupation.\n" \
"\n" \
"\"How did you know what I was doing?  I believe you have eyes in\n" \
"the back of your head.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in\n" \
"front of me,\" said he.  \"But, tell me, Watson, what do you make\n" \
"of our visitor's stick?  Since we have been so unfortunate as to\n" \
"miss him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir\n" \
"becomes of importance.  Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an\n" \
"examination of it.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"I think,\" said I, following as far as I could the methods of my\n" \
"companion, \"that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical\n" \
"man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark\n" \
"of their appreciation.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Good!\" said Holmes.  \"Excellent!\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a\n" \
"country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Why so?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been\n" \
"so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner\n" \
"carrying it.  The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident\n" \
"that he has done a great amount of walking with it.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Perfectly sound!\" said Holmes.\n" \
"\n" \
"\"And then again, there is the 'friends of the C.C.H.'  I should\n" \
"guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose\n" \
"members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which\n" \
"has made him a small presentation in return.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Really, Watson, you excel yourself,\" said Holmes, pushing back\n" \
"his chair and lighting a cigarette.  \"I am bound to say that in\n" \
"all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my\n" \
"own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own\n" \
"abilities.  It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but\n" \
"you are a conductor of light.  Some people without possessing\n" \
"genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it.  I confess, my\n" \
"dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words\n" \
"gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his\n" \
"indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had\n" \
"made to give publicity to his methods.  I was proud, too, to\n" \
"think that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a\n" \
"way which earned his approval.  He now took the stick from my\n" \
"hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes.\n" \
"Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette,\n" \
"and carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with\n" \
"a convex lens.\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Interesting, though elementary,\" said he as he returned to his\n" \
"favourite corner of the settee.  \"There are certainly one or two\n" \
"indications upon the stick.  It gives us the basis for several\n" \
"deductions.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Has anything escaped me?\"  I asked with some self-importance.\n" \
"\"I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have\n" \
"overlooked?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were\n" \
"erroneous.  When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be\n" \
"frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided\n" \
"towards the truth.  Not that you are entirely wrong in this\n" \
"instance.  The man is certainly a country practitioner.  And he\n" \
"walks a good deal.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Then I was right.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"To that extent.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"But that was all.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"No, no, my dear Watson, not all--by no means all.  I would\n" \
"suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more\n" \
"likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when\n" \
"the initials 'C.C.' are placed before that hospital the words\n" \
"'Charing Cross' very naturally suggest themselves.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"You may be right.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"The probability lies in that direction.  And if we take this as\n" \
"a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start\n" \
"our construction of this unknown visitor.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Well, then, supposing that 'C.C.H.' does stand for 'Charing Cross\n" \
"Hospital,' what further inferences may we draw?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Do none suggest themselves?  You know my methods.  Apply them!\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has\n" \
"practised in town before going to the country.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"I think that we might venture a little farther than this.  Look\n" \
"at it in this light.  On what occasion would it be most probable\n" \
"that such a presentation would be made?  When would his friends\n" \
"unite to give him a pledge of their good will?  Obviously at the\n" \
"moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital\n" \
"in order to start a practice for himself.  We know there has been\n" \
"a presentation.  We believe there has been a change from a town\n" \
"hospital to a country practice.  Is it, then, stretching our\n" \
"inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion\n" \
"of the change?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"It certainly seems probable.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff\n" \
"of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London\n" \
"practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not\n" \
"drift into the country.  What was he, then?  If he was in the\n" \
"hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a\n" \
"house-surgeon or a house-physician--little more than a senior\n" \
"student.  And he left five years ago--the date is on the stick.\n" \
"So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin\n" \
"air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,\n" \
"amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a\n" \
"favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger\n" \
"than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his\n" \
"settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.\n" \
"\n" \
"\"As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,\" said I,\n" \
"\"but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars\n" \
"about the man's age and professional career.\"  From my small\n" \
"medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up\n" \
"the name.  There were several Mortimers, but only one who could\n" \
"be our visitor.  I read his record aloud.\n" \
"\n" \
"        \"Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.\n" \
"        House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.\n" \
"        Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology,\n" \
"        with essay entitled 'Is Disease a Reversion?'  Corresponding\n" \
"        member of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of\n" \
"        'Some Freaks of Atavism' (Lancet 1882).  'Do We Progress?'\n" \
"        (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883).  Medical Officer\n" \
"        for the parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"No mention of that local hunt, Watson,\" said Holmes with a\n" \
"mischievous smile, \"but a country doctor, as you very astutely\n" \
"observed.  I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences.\n" \
"As to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable,\n" \
"unambitious, and absent-minded.  It is my experience that it is\n" \
"only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only\n" \
"an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country,\n" \
"and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his\n" \
"visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"And the dog?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master.\n" \
"Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle,\n" \
"and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible.  The dog's\n" \
"jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in\n" \
"my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff.  It\n" \
"may have been--yes, by Jove, it is a curly-haired spaniel.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"He had risen and paced the room as he spoke.  Now he halted in\n" \
"the recess of the window.  There was such a ring of conviction\n" \
"in his voice that I glanced up in surprise.\n" \
"\n" \
"\"My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our\n" \
"very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner.  Don't move,\n" \
"I beg you, Watson.  He is a professional brother of yours, and\n" \
"your presence may be of assistance to me.  Now is the dramatic\n" \
"moment of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which\n" \
"is walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or\n" \
"ill.  What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of\n" \
"Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime?  Come in!\"\n" \
"\n" \
"The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had\n" \
"expected a typical country practitioner.  He was a very tall,\n" \
"thin man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between\n" \
"two keen, gray eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly\n" \
"from behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses.  He was clad in a\n" \
"professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was\n" \
"dingy and his trousers frayed.  Though young, his long back was\n" \
"already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head\n" \
"and a general air of peering benevolence.  As he entered his eyes\n" \
"fell upon the stick in Holmes's hand, and he ran towards it with\n" \
"an exclamation of joy.  \"I am so very glad,\" said he.  \"I was not\n" \
"sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office.  I\n" \
"would not lose that stick for the world.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"A presentation, I see,\" said Holmes.\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Yes, sir.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"From Charing Cross Hospital?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Dear, dear, that's bad!\" said Holmes, shaking his head.\n" \
"\n" \
"Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.\n" \
"\"Why was it bad?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Only that you have disarranged our little deductions.  Your\n" \
"marriage, you say?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Yes, sir.  I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all\n" \
"hopes of a consulting practice.  It was necessary to make a home\n" \
"of my own.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,\" said Holmes.\n" \
"\"And now, Dr. James Mortimer--\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Mister, sir, Mister--a humble M.R.C.S.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"And a man of precise mind, evidently.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the\n" \
"shores of the great unknown ocean.  I presume that it is\n" \
"Mr. Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not--\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Glad to meet you, sir.  I have heard your name mentioned in\n" \
"connection with that of your friend.  You interest me very much,\n" \
"Mr. Holmes.  I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or\n" \
"such well-marked supra-orbital development.  Would you have any\n" \
"objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure?\n" \
"A cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would\n" \
"be an ornament to any anthropological museum.  It is not my\n" \
"intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair.  \"You are\n" \
"an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am\n" \
"in mine,\" said he.  \"I observe from your forefinger that you make\n" \
"your own cigarettes.  Have no hesitation in lighting one.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the\n" \
"other with surprising dexterity.  He had long, quivering fingers\n" \
"as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect.\n" \
"\n" \
"Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the\n" \
"interest which he took in our curious companion.  \"I presume, sir,\"\n" \
"said he at last, \"that it was not merely for the purpose of\n" \
"examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here\n" \
"last night and again today?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of\n" \
"doing that as well.  I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized\n" \
"that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly\n" \
"confronted with a most serious and extraordinary problem.\n" \
"Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest expert in\n" \
"Europe--\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Indeed, sir!  May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?\"\n" \
"asked Holmes with some asperity.\n" \
"\n" \
"\"To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur\n" \
"Bertillon must always appeal strongly.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Then had you not better consult him?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind.  But as a practical\n" \
"man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone.  I trust,\n" \
"sir, that I have not inadvertently--\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Just a little,\" said Holmes.  \"I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would\n" \
"do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly\n" \
"what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my\n" \
"assistance.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\n" \
"\n" \
"\n" \
"Chapter 2\n" \
"The Curse of the Baskervilles\n" \
"\n" \
"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"I have in my pocket a manuscript,\" said Dr. James Mortimer.\n" \
"\n" \
"\"I observed it as you entered the room,\" said Holmes.\n" \
"\n" \
"\"It is an old manuscript.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"How can you say that, sir?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all\n" \
"the time that you have been talking.  It would be a poor expert\n" \
"who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so.\n" \
"You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject.\n" \
"I put that at 1730.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"The exact date is 1742.\"  Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast-\n" \
"pocket.  \"This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles\n" \
"Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago\n" \
"created so much excitement in Devonshire.  I may say that I was\n" \
"his personal friend as well as his medical attendant.  He was a\n" \
"strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as unimaginative\n" \
"as I am myself.  Yet he took this document very seriously, and\n" \
"his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually\n" \
"overtake him.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it\n" \
"upon his knee.  \"You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of\n" \
"the long s and the short.  It is one of several indications which\n" \
"enabled me to fix the date.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script.\n" \
"At the head was written: \"Baskerville Hall,\" and below in large,\n" \
"scrawling figures: \"1742.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"It appears to be a statement of some sort.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the\n" \
"Baskerville family.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"But I understand that it is something more modern and practical\n" \
"upon which you wish to consult me?\"\n" \
"\n" \
"\"Most modern.  A most practical, pressing matter, which must be\n" \
"decided within twenty-four hours.  But the manuscript is short\n" \
"and is intimately connected with the affair.  With your permission\n" \
"I will read it to you.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together,\n" \
"and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation.  Dr. Mortimer\n" \
"turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking\n" \
"voice the following curious, old-world narrative:\n" \
"\n" \
"        \"Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there\n" \
"        have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct\n" \
"        line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story from\n" \
"        my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down\n" \
"        with all belief that it occurred even as is here set\n" \
"        forth.  And I would have you believe, my sons, that the\n" \
"        same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously\n" \
"        forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer\n" \
"        and repentance it may be removed.  Learn then from this\n" \
"        story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to\n" \
"        be circumspect in the future, that those foul passions\n" \
"        whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not\n" \
"        again be loosed to our undoing.\n" \
"\n" \
"        \"Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the\n" \
"        history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most\n" \
"        earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of\n" \
"        Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be\n" \
"        gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless\n" \
"        man.  This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned,\n" \
"        seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts,\n" \
"        but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour\n" \
"        which made his name a by-word through the West.  It\n" \
"        chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark\n" \
"        a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter\n" \
"        of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate.\n" \
"        But the young maiden, being discreet and of good repute,\n" \
"        would ever avoid him, for she feared his evil name.  So\n" \
"        it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with five\n" \
"        or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down upon\n" \
"        the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and\n" \
"        brothers being from home, as he well knew.  When they had\n" \
"        brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper\n" \
"        chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long\n" \
"        carouse, as was their nightly custom.  Now, the poor lass\n" \
"        upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing\n" \
"        and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from\n" \
"        below, for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville,\n" \
"        when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who\n" \
"        said them.  At last in the stress of her fear she did that\n" \
"        which might have daunted the bravest or most active man,\n" \
"        for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and\n" \
"        still covers) the south wall she came down from under the\n" \
"        eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three\n" \
"        leagues betwixt the Hall and her father's farm.\n" \
"\n" \
"        \"It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his\n" \
"        guests to carry food and drink--with other worse things,\n" \
"        perchance--to his captive, and so found the cage empty\n" \
"        and the bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became\n" \
"        as one that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs\n" \
"        into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table,\n" \
"        flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he cried\n" \
"        aloud before all the company that he would that very\n" \
"        night render his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if\n" \
"        he might but overtake the wench.  And while the revellers\n" \
"        stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or,\n" \
"        it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that\n" \
"        they should put the hounds upon her.  Whereat Hugo ran\n" \
"        from the house, crying to his grooms that they should\n" \
"        saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the\n" \
"        hounds a kerchief of the maid's, he swung them to the\n" \
"        line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor.\n" \
"\n" \
"        \"Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable\n" \
"        to understand all that had been done in such haste.  But\n" \
"        anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed\n" \
"        which was like to be done upon the moorlands.  Everything\n" \
"        was now in an uproar, some calling for their pistols,\n" \
"        some for their horses, and some for another flask of\n" \
"        wine.  But at length some sense came back to their crazed\n" \
"        minds, and the whole of them, thirteen in number, took\n" \
"        horse and started in pursuit.  The moon shone clear above\n" \
"        them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course\n" \
"        which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach\n" \
"        her own home.\n" \
"\n" \
"        \"They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the\n" \
"        night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to\n" \
"        him to know if he had seen the hunt.  And the man, as\n" \
"        the story goes, was so crazed with fear that he could\n" \
"        scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed seen\n" \
"        the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  'But\n" \
"        I have seen more than that,' said he, 'for Hugo Baskerville\n" \
"        passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind\n" \
"        him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at\n" \
"        my heels.'  So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd\n" \
"        and rode onward.  But soon their skins turned cold, for\n" \
"        there came a galloping across the moor, and the black\n" \
"        mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing\n" \
"        bridle and empty saddle.  Then the revellers rode close\n" \
"        together, for a great fear was on them, but they still\n" \
"        followed over the moor, though each, had he been alone,\n" \
"        would have been right glad to have turned his horse's\n" \
"        head.  Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last\n" \
"        upon the hounds.  These, though known for their valour\n" \
"        and their breed, were whimpering in a cluster at the\n" \
"        head of a deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the\n" \
"        moor, some slinking away and some, with starting hackles\n" \
"        and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before them.\n" \
"\n" \
"        \"The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you\n" \
"        may guess, than when they started.  The most of them\n" \
"        would by no means advance, but three of them, the boldest,\n" \
"        or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal.\n" \
"        Now, it opened into a broad space in which stood two of\n" \
"        those great stones, still to be seen there, which were\n" \
"        set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old.\n" \
"        The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there\n" \
"        in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen,\n" \
"        dead of fear and of fatigue.  But it was not the sight\n" \
"        of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo\n" \
"        Baskerville lying near her, which raised the hair upon\n" \
"        the heads of these three dare-devil roysterers, but it\n" \
"        was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his throat,\n" \
"        there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped\n" \
"        like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal\n" \
"        eye has rested upon.  And even as they looked the thing\n" \
"        tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it\n" \
"        turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the\n" \
"        three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still\n" \
"        screaming, across the moor.  One, it is said, died that\n" \
"        very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were\n" \
"        but broken men for the rest of their days.\n" \
"\n" \
"        \"Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound\n" \
"        which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever\n" \
"        since.  If I have set it down it is because that which\n" \
"        is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but\n" \
"        hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that many\n" \
"        of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which\n" \
"        have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we\n" \
"        shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence,\n" \
"        which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that\n" \
"        third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy\n" \
"        Writ.  To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend\n" \
"        you, and I counsel you by way of caution to forbear from\n" \
"        crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of\n" \
"        evil are exalted.\n"

"I. THE RIVER BANK\n" \
"\n" \
"The Mole had been working very hard all the morning, spring-cleaning his\n" \
"little home. First with brooms, then with dusters; then on ladders and\n" \
"steps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till he had dust\n" \
"in his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over his black\n" \
"fur, and an aching back and weary arms. Spring was moving in the air\n" \
"above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even his dark\n" \
"and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and longing.\n" \
"It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his brush on the\n" \
"floor, said 'Bother!' and 'O blow!' and also 'Hang spring-cleaning!'\n" \
"and bolted out of the house without even waiting to put on his coat.\n" \
"Something up above was calling him imperiously, and he made for\n" \
"the steep little tunnel which answered in his case to the graveled\n" \
"carriage-drive owned by animals whose residences are nearer to the sun\n" \
"and air. So he scraped and scratched and scrabbled and scrooged and\n" \
"then he scrooged again and scrabbled and scratched and scraped, working\n" \
"busily with his little paws and muttering to himself, 'Up we go! Up we\n" \
"go!' till at last, pop! his snout came out into the sunlight, and he\n" \
"found himself rolling in the warm grass of a great meadow.\n" \
"\n" \
"'This is fine!' he said to himself. 'This is better than whitewashing!'\n" \
"The sunshine struck hot on his fur, soft breezes caressed his heated\n" \
"brow, and after the seclusion of the cellarage he had lived in so long\n" \
"the carol of happy birds fell on his dulled hearing almost like a shout.\n" \
"Jumping off all his four legs at once, in the joy of living and the\n" \
"delight of spring without its cleaning, he pursued his way across the\n" \
"meadow till he reached the hedge on the further side.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Hold up!' said an elderly rabbit at the gap. 'Sixpence for the\n" \
"privilege of passing by the private road!' He was bowled over in an\n" \
"instant by the impatient and contemptuous Mole, who trotted along the\n" \
"side of the hedge chaffing the other rabbits as they peeped hurriedly\n" \
"from their holes to see what the row was about. 'Onion-sauce!\n" \
"Onion-sauce!' he remarked jeeringly, and was gone before they could\n" \
"think of a thoroughly satisfactory reply. Then they all started\n" \
"grumbling at each other. 'How STUPID you are! Why didn't you tell\n" \
"him----' 'Well, why didn't YOU say----' 'You might have reminded\n" \
"him----' and so on, in the usual way; but, of course, it was then much\n" \
"too late, as is always the case.\n" \
"\n" \
"It all seemed too good to be true. Hither and thither through the\n" \
"meadows he rambled busily, along the hedgerows, across the\n" \
"copses, finding everywhere birds building, flowers budding, leaves\n" \
"thrusting--everything happy, and progressive, and occupied. And instead\n" \
"of having an uneasy conscience pricking him and whispering 'whitewash!'\n" \
"he somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog\n" \
"among all these busy citizens. After all, the best part of a holiday\n" \
"is perhaps not so much to be resting yourself, as to see all the other\n" \
"fellows busy working.\n" \
"\n" \
"He thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly\n" \
"along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in\n" \
"his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied\n" \
"animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and\n" \
"leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook\n" \
"themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake and\n" \
"a-shiver--glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter and\n" \
"bubble. The Mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated. By the side of\n" \
"the river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a man\n" \
"who holds one spell-bound by exciting stories; and when tired at\n" \
"last, he sat on the bank, while the river still chattered on to him,\n" \
"a babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the\n" \
"heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea.\n" \
"\n" \
"As he sat on the grass and looked across the river, a dark hole in the\n" \
"bank opposite, just above the water's edge, caught his eye, and dreamily\n" \
"he fell to considering what a nice snug dwelling-place it would make for\n" \
"an animal with few wants and fond of a bijou riverside residence, above\n" \
"flood level and remote from noise and dust. As he gazed, something\n" \
"bright and small seemed to twinkle down in the heart of it, vanished,\n" \
"then twinkled once more like a tiny star. But it could hardly be a star\n" \
"in such an unlikely situation; and it was too glittering and small for a\n" \
"glow-worm. Then, as he looked, it winked at him, and so declared itself\n" \
"to be an eye; and a small face began gradually to grow up round it, like\n" \
"a frame round a picture.\n" \
"\n" \
"A brown little face, with whiskers.\n" \
"\n" \
"A grave round face, with the same twinkle in its eye that had first\n" \
"attracted his notice.\n" \
"\n" \
"Small neat ears and thick silky hair.\n" \
"\n" \
"It was the Water Rat!\n" \
"\n" \
"Then the two animals stood and regarded each other cautiously.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Hullo, Mole!' said the Water Rat.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Hullo, Rat!' said the Mole.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Would you like to come over?' enquired the Rat presently.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Oh, its all very well to TALK,' said the Mole, rather pettishly, he\n" \
"being new to a river and riverside life and its ways.\n" \
"\n" \
"The Rat said nothing, but stooped and unfastened a rope and hauled\n" \
"on it; then lightly stepped into a little boat which the Mole had not\n" \
"observed. It was painted blue outside and white within, and was just the\n" \
"size for two animals; and the Mole's whole heart went out to it at once,\n" \
"even though he did not yet fully understand its uses.\n" \
"\n" \
"The Rat sculled smartly across and made fast. Then he held up his\n" \
"forepaw as the Mole stepped gingerly down. 'Lean on that!' he said.\n" \
"'Now then, step lively!' and the Mole to his surprise and rapture found\n" \
"himself actually seated in the stern of a real boat.\n" \
"\n" \
"'This has been a wonderful day!' said he, as the Rat shoved off and took\n" \
"to the sculls again. 'Do you know, I've never been in a boat before in\n" \
"all my life.'\n" \
"\n" \
"'What?' cried the Rat, open-mouthed: 'Never been in a--you never--well\n" \
"I--what have you been doing, then?'\n" \
"\n" \
"'Is it so nice as all that?' asked the Mole shyly, though he was quite\n" \
"prepared to believe it as he leant back in his seat and surveyed the\n" \
"cushions, the oars, the rowlocks, and all the fascinating fittings, and\n" \
"felt the boat sway lightly under him.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Nice? It's the ONLY thing,' said the Water Rat solemnly, as he\n" \
"leant forward for his stroke. 'Believe me, my young friend, there is\n" \
"NOTHING--absolute nothing--half so much worth doing as simply\n" \
"messing about in boats. Simply messing,' he went on dreamily:\n" \
"'messing--about--in--boats; messing----'\n" \
"\n" \
"'Look ahead, Rat!' cried the Mole suddenly.\n" \
"\n" \
"It was too late. The boat struck the bank full tilt. The dreamer, the\n" \
"joyous oarsman, lay on his back at the bottom of the boat, his heels in\n" \
"the air.\n" \
"\n" \
"'--about in boats--or WITH boats,' the Rat went on composedly, picking\n" \
"himself up with a pleasant laugh. 'In or out of 'em, it doesn't matter.\n" \
"Nothing seems really to matter, that's the charm of it. Whether you get\n" \
"away, or whether you don't; whether you arrive at your destination or\n" \
"whether you reach somewhere else, or whether you never get anywhere at\n" \
"all, you're always busy, and you never do anything in particular; and\n" \
"when you've done it there's always something else to do, and you can do\n" \
"it if you like, but you'd much better not. Look here! If you've really\n" \
"nothing else on hand this morning, supposing we drop down the river\n" \
"together, and have a long day of it?'\n" \
"\n" \
"The Mole waggled his toes from sheer happiness, spread his chest with\n" \
"a sigh of full contentment, and leaned back blissfully into the soft\n" \
"cushions. 'WHAT a day I'm having!' he said. 'Let us start at once!'\n" \
"\n" \
"'Hold hard a minute, then!' said the Rat. He looped the painter through\n" \
"a ring in his landing-stage, climbed up into his hole above, and after\n" \
"a short interval reappeared staggering under a fat, wicker\n" \
"luncheon-basket.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Shove that under your feet,' he observed to the Mole, as he passed\n" \
"it down into the boat. Then he untied the painter and took the sculls\n" \
"again.\n" \
"\n" \
"'What's inside it?' asked the Mole, wriggling with curiosity.\n" \
"\n" \
"'There's cold chicken inside it,' replied the Rat briefly;\n" \
"'coldtonguecoldhamcoldbeefpickledgherkinssaladfrenchrollscresssan\n" \
"dwichespottedmeatgingerbeerlemonadesodawater----'\n" \
"\n" \
"'O stop, stop,' cried the Mole in ecstacies: 'This is too much!'\n" \
"\n" \
"'Do you really think so?' enquired the Rat seriously. 'It's only what I\n" \
"always take on these little excursions; and the other animals are always\n" \
"telling me that I'm a mean beast and cut it VERY fine!'\n" \
"\n" \
"The Mole never heard a word he was saying. Absorbed in the new life he\n" \
"was entering upon, intoxicated with the sparkle, the ripple, the scents\n" \
"and the sounds and the sunlight, he trailed a paw in the water and\n" \
"dreamed long waking dreams. The Water Rat, like the good little fellow\n" \
"he was, sculled steadily on and forebore to disturb him.\n" \
"\n" \
"'I like your clothes awfully, old chap,' he remarked after some half\n" \
"an hour or so had passed. 'I'm going to get a black velvet smoking-suit\n" \
"myself some day, as soon as I can afford it.'\n" \
"\n" \
"'I beg your pardon,' said the Mole, pulling himself together with an\n" \
"effort. 'You must think me very rude; but all this is so new to me.\n" \
"So--this--is--a--River!'\n" \
"\n" \
"'THE River,' corrected the Rat.\n" \
"\n" \
"'And you really live by the river? What a jolly life!'\n" \
"\n" \
"'By it and with it and on it and in it,' said the Rat. 'It's brother\n" \
"and sister to me, and aunts, and company, and food and drink, and\n" \
"(naturally) washing. It's my world, and I don't want any other. What it\n" \
"hasn't got is not worth having, and what it doesn't know is not worth\n" \
"knowing. Lord! the times we've had together! Whether in winter or\n" \
"summer, spring or autumn, it's always got its fun and its excitements.\n" \
"When the floods are on in February, and my cellars and basement are\n" \
"brimming with drink that's no good to me, and the brown water runs by my\n" \
"best bedroom window; or again when it all drops away and, shows patches\n" \
"of mud that smells like plum-cake, and the rushes and weed clog the\n" \
"channels, and I can potter about dry shod over most of the bed of it and\n" \
"find fresh food to eat, and things careless people have dropped out of\n" \
"boats!'\n" \
"\n" \
"'But isn't it a bit dull at times?' the Mole ventured to ask. 'Just you\n" \
"and the river, and no one else to pass a word with?'\n" \
"\n" \
"'No one else to--well, I mustn't be hard on you,' said the Rat with\n" \
"forbearance. 'You're new to it, and of course you don't know. The bank\n" \
"is so crowded nowadays that many people are moving away altogether: O\n" \
"no, it isn't what it used to be, at all. Otters, kingfishers, dabchicks,\n" \
"moorhens, all of them about all day long and always wanting you to DO\n" \
"something--as if a fellow had no business of his own to attend to!'\n" \
"\n" \
"'What lies over THERE' asked the Mole, waving a paw towards a background\n" \
"of woodland that darkly framed the water-meadows on one side of the\n" \
"river.\n" \
"\n" \
"'That? O, that's just the Wild Wood,' said the Rat shortly. 'We don't go\n" \
"there very much, we river-bankers.'\n" \
"\n" \
"'Aren't they--aren't they very NICE people in there?' said the Mole, a\n" \
"trifle nervously.\n" \
"\n" \
"'W-e-ll,' replied the Rat, 'let me see. The squirrels are all right. AND\n" \
"the rabbits--some of 'em, but rabbits are a mixed lot. And then there's\n" \
"Badger, of course. He lives right in the heart of it; wouldn't live\n" \
"anywhere else, either, if you paid him to do it. Dear old Badger! Nobody\n" \
"interferes with HIM. They'd better not,' he added significantly.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Why, who SHOULD interfere with him?' asked the Mole.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Well, of course--there--are others,' explained the Rat in a hesitating\n" \
"sort of way.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Weasels--and stoats--and foxes--and so on. They're all right in a\n" \
"way--I'm very good friends with them--pass the time of day when we meet,\n" \
"and all that--but they break out sometimes, there's no denying it, and\n" \
"then--well, you can't really trust them, and that's the fact.'\n" \
"\n" \
"The Mole knew well that it is quite against animal-etiquette to dwell\n" \
"on possible trouble ahead, or even to allude to it; so he dropped the\n" \
"subject.\n" \
"\n" \
"'And beyond the Wild Wood again?' he asked: 'Where it's all blue\n" \
"and dim, and one sees what may be hills or perhaps they mayn't, and\n" \
"something like the smoke of towns, or is it only cloud-drift?'\n" \
"\n" \
"'Beyond the Wild Wood comes the Wide World,' said the Rat. 'And that's\n" \
"something that doesn't matter, either to you or me. I've never been\n" \
"there, and I'm never going, nor you either, if you've got any sense\n" \
"at all. Don't ever refer to it again, please. Now then! Here's our\n" \
"backwater at last, where we're going to lunch.'\n" \
"\n" \
"Leaving the main stream, they now passed into what seemed at first sight\n" \
"like a little land-locked lake. Green turf sloped down to either edge,\n" \
"brown snaky tree-roots gleamed below the surface of the quiet water,\n" \
"while ahead of them the silvery shoulder and foamy tumble of a weir,\n" \
"arm-in-arm with a restless dripping mill-wheel, that held up in its\n" \
"turn a grey-gabled mill-house, filled the air with a soothing murmur\n" \
"of sound, dull and smothery, yet with little clear voices speaking up\n" \
"cheerfully out of it at intervals. It was so very beautiful that the\n" \
"Mole could only hold up both forepaws and gasp, 'O my! O my! O my!'\n" \
"\n" \
"The Rat brought the boat alongside the bank, made her fast, helped the\n" \
"still awkward Mole safely ashore, and swung out the luncheon-basket. The\n" \
"Mole begged as a favour to be allowed to unpack it all by himself; and\n" \
"the Rat was very pleased to indulge him, and to sprawl at full length on\n" \
"the grass and rest, while his excited friend shook out the table-cloth\n" \
"and spread it, took out all the mysterious packets one by one and\n" \
"arranged their contents in due order, still gasping, 'O my! O my!' at\n" \
"each fresh revelation. When all was ready, the Rat said, 'Now, pitch\n" \
"in, old fellow!' and the Mole was indeed very glad to obey, for he had\n" \
"started his spring-cleaning at a very early hour that morning, as people\n" \
"WILL do, and had not paused for bite or sup; and he had been through a\n" \
"very great deal since that distant time which now seemed so many days\n" \
"ago.\n" \
"\n" \
"'What are you looking at?' said the Rat presently, when the edge of\n" \
"their hunger was somewhat dulled, and the Mole's eyes were able to\n" \
"wander off the table-cloth a little.\n" \
"\n" \
"'I am looking,' said the Mole, 'at a streak of bubbles that I see\n" \
"travelling along the surface of the water. That is a thing that strikes\n" \
"me as funny.'\n" \
"\n" \
"'Bubbles? Oho!' said the Rat, and chirruped cheerily in an inviting sort\n" \
"of way.\n" \
"\n" \
"A broad glistening muzzle showed itself above the edge of the bank, and\n" \
"the Otter hauled himself out and shook the water from his coat.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Greedy beggars!' he observed, making for the provender. 'Why didn't you\n" \
"invite me, Ratty?'\n" \
"\n" \
"'This was an impromptu affair,' explained the Rat. 'By the way--my\n" \
"friend Mr. Mole.'\n" \
"\n" \
"'Proud, I'm sure,' said the Otter, and the two animals were friends\n" \
"forthwith.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Such a rumpus everywhere!' continued the Otter. 'All the world seems\n" \
"out on the river to-day. I came up this backwater to try and get a\n" \
"moment's peace, and then stumble upon you fellows!--At least--I beg\n" \
"pardon--I don't exactly mean that, you know.'\n" \
"\n" \
"There was a rustle behind them, proceeding from a hedge wherein last\n" \
"year's leaves still clung thick, and a stripy head, with high shoulders\n" \
"behind it, peered forth on them.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Come on, old Badger!' shouted the Rat.\n" \
"\n" \
"The Badger trotted forward a pace or two; then grunted, 'H'm! Company,'\n" \
"and turned his back and disappeared from view.\n" \
"\n" \
"'That's JUST the sort of fellow he is!' observed the disappointed Rat.\n" \
"'Simply hates Society! Now we shan't see any more of him to-day. Well,\n" \
"tell us, WHO'S out on the river?'\n" \
"\n" \
"'Toad's out, for one,' replied the Otter. 'In his brand-new wager-boat;\n" \
"new togs, new everything!'\n" \
"\n" \
"The two animals looked at each other and laughed.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Once, it was nothing but sailing,' said the Rat, 'Then he tired of that\n" \
"and took to punting. Nothing would please him but to punt all day\n" \
"and every day, and a nice mess he made of it. Last year it was\n" \
"house-boating, and we all had to go and stay with him in his house-boat,\n" \
"and pretend we liked it. He was going to spend the rest of his life in\n" \
"a house-boat. It's all the same, whatever he takes up; he gets tired of\n" \
"it, and starts on something fresh.'\n" \
"\n" \
"'Such a good fellow, too,' remarked the Otter reflectively: 'But no\n" \
"stability--especially in a boat!'\n" \
"\n" \
"From where they sat they could get a glimpse of the main stream across\n" \
"the island that separated them; and just then a wager-boat flashed into\n" \
"view, the rower--a short, stout figure--splashing badly and rolling a\n" \
"good deal, but working his hardest. The Rat stood up and hailed him, but\n" \
"Toad--for it was he--shook his head and settled sternly to his work.\n" \
"\n" \
"'He'll be out of the boat in a minute if he rolls like that,' said the\n" \
"Rat, sitting down again.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Of course he will,' chuckled the Otter. 'Did I ever tell you that good\n" \
"story about Toad and the lock-keeper? It happened this way. Toad....'\n" \
"\n" \
"An errant May-fly swerved unsteadily athwart the current in the\n" \
"intoxicated fashion affected by young bloods of May-flies seeing life. A\n" \
"swirl of water and a 'cloop!' and the May-fly was visible no more.\n" \
"\n" \
"Neither was the Otter.\n" \
"\n" \
"The Mole looked down. The voice was still in his ears, but the turf\n" \
"whereon he had sprawled was clearly vacant. Not an Otter to be seen, as\n" \
"far as the distant horizon.\n" \
"\n" \
"But again there was a streak of bubbles on the surface of the river.\n" \
"\n" \
"The Rat hummed a tune, and the Mole recollected that animal-etiquette\n" \
"forbade any sort of comment on the sudden disappearance of one's friends\n" \
"at any moment, for any reason or no reason whatever.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Well, well,' said the Rat, 'I suppose we ought to be moving. I wonder\n" \
"which of us had better pack the luncheon-basket?' He did not speak as if\n" \
"he was frightfully eager for the treat.\n" \
"\n" \
"'O, please let me,' said the Mole. So, of course, the Rat let him.\n" \
"\n" \
"Packing the basket was not quite such pleasant work as unpacking' the\n" \
"basket. It never is. But the Mole was bent on enjoying everything, and\n" \
"although just when he had got the basket packed and strapped up tightly\n" \
"he saw a plate staring up at him from the grass, and when the job had\n" \
"been done again the Rat pointed out a fork which anybody ought to\n" \
"have seen, and last of all, behold! the mustard pot, which he had been\n" \
"sitting on without knowing it--still, somehow, the thing got finished at\n" \
"last, without much loss of temper.\n" \
"\n" \
"The afternoon sun was getting low as the Rat sculled gently homewards in\n" \
"a dreamy mood, murmuring poetry-things over to himself, and not paying\n" \
"much attention to Mole. But the Mole was very full of lunch, and\n" \
"self-satisfaction, and pride, and already quite at home in a boat (so he\n" \
"thought) and was getting a bit restless besides: and presently he said,\n" \
"'Ratty! Please, _I_ want to row, now!'\n" \
"\n" \
"The Rat shook his head with a smile. 'Not yet, my young friend,' he\n" \
"said--'wait till you've had a few lessons. It's not so easy as it\n" \
"looks.'\n" \
"\n" \
"The Mole was quiet for a minute or two. But he began to feel more and\n" \
"more jealous of Rat, sculling so strongly and so easily along, and his\n" \
"pride began to whisper that he could do it every bit as well. He jumped\n" \
"up and seized the sculls, so suddenly, that the Rat, who was gazing out\n" \
"over the water and saying more poetry-things to himself, was taken by\n" \
"surprise and fell backwards off his seat with his legs in the air for\n" \
"the second time, while the triumphant Mole took his place and grabbed\n" \
"the sculls with entire confidence.\n" \
"\n" \
"'Stop it, you SILLY ass!' cried the Rat, from the bottom of the boat.\n" \
"'You can't do it! You'll have us over!'\n" \
"\n" \
"The Mole flung his sculls back with a flourish, and made a great dig at\n" \
"the water. He missed the surface altogether, his legs flew up above\n" \
"his head, and he found himself lying on the top of the prostrate Rat.\n" \
"Greatly alarmed, he made a grab at the side of the boat, and the next\n" \
"moment--Sploosh!\n" \
"\n" \
"Over went the boat, and he found himself struggling in the river.\n" \
"\n" \
"O my, how cold the water was, and O, how VERY wet it felt. How it sang\n" \
"in his ears as he went down, down, down! How bright and welcome the sun\n" \
"looked as he rose to the surface coughing and spluttering! How black was\n" \
"his despair when he felt himself sinking again! Then a firm paw gripped\n" \
"him by the back of his neck. It was the Rat, and he was evidently\n" \
"laughing--the Mole could FEEL him laughing, right down his arm and\n" \
"through his paw, and so into his--the Mole's--neck.\n" \
"\n" \
"The Rat got hold of a scull and shoved it under the Mole's arm; then he\n" \
"did the same by the other side of him and, swimming behind, propelled\n" \
"the helpless animal to shore, hauled him out, and set him down on the\n" \
"bank, a squashy, pulpy lump of misery.\n" \
"\n" \
"When the Rat had rubbed him down a bit, and wrung some of the wet out of\n" \
"him, he said, 'Now, then, old fellow! Trot up and down the towing-path\n" \
"as hard as you can, till you're warm and dry again, while I dive for the\n" \
"luncheon-basket.'\n" \
"\n" \
"So the dismal Mole, wet without and ashamed within, trotted about till\n" \
"he was fairly dry, while the Rat plunged into the water again, recovered\n" \
"the boat, righted her and made her fast, fetched his floating\n" \
"property to shore by degrees, and finally dived successfully for the\n" \
"luncheon-basket and struggled to land with it.\n" \
"\n" \
"When all was ready for a start once more, the Mole, limp and dejected,\n" \
"took his seat in the stern of the boat; and as they set off, he said in\n" \
"a low voice, broken with emotion, 'Ratty, my generous friend! I am very\n" \
"sorry indeed for my foolish and ungrateful conduct. My heart quite fails\n" \
"me when I think how I might have lost that beautiful luncheon-basket.\n" \
"Indeed, I have been a complete ass, and I know it. Will you overlook it\n" \
"this once and forgive me, and let things go on as before?'\n" \
"\n" \
"'That's all right, bless you!' responded the Rat cheerily. 'What's a\n" \
"little wet to a Water Rat? I'm more in the water than out of it most\n" \
"days. Don't you think any more about it; and, look here! I really think\n" \
"you had better come and stop with me for a little time. It's very plain\n" \
"and rough, you know--not like Toad's house at all--but you haven't seen\n" \
"that yet; still, I can make you comfortable. And I'll teach you to row,\n" \
"and to swim, and you'll soon be as handy on the water as any of us.'\n" \
"\n" \
"The Mole was so touched by his kind manner of speaking that he could\n" \
"find no voice to answer him; and he had to brush away a tear or two with\n" \
"the back of his paw. But the Rat kindly looked in another direction, and\n" \
"presently the Mole's spirits revived again, and he was even able to give\n" \
"some straight back-talk to a couple of moorhens who were sniggering to\n" \
"each other about his bedraggled appearance.\n" \
"\n" \
"When they got home, the Rat made a bright fire in the parlour, and\n" \
"planted the Mole in an arm-chair in front of it, having fetched down\n" \
"a dressing-gown and slippers for him, and told him river stories till\n" \
"supper-time. Very thrilling stories they were, too, to an earth-dwelling\n" \
"animal like Mole. Stories about weirs, and sudden floods, and leaping\n" \
"pike, and steamers that flung hard bottles--at least bottles were\n" \
"certainly flung, and FROM steamers, so presumably BY them; and about\n" \
"herons, and how particular they were whom they spoke to; and about\n" \
"adventures down drains, and night-fishings with Otter, or excursions far\n" \
"a-field with Badger. Supper was a most cheerful meal; but very shortly\n" \
"afterwards a terribly sleepy Mole had to be escorted upstairs by his\n" \
"considerate host, to the best bedroom, where he soon laid his head on\n" \
"his pillow in great peace and contentment, knowing that his new-found\n" \
"friend the River was lapping the sill of his window.\n" \
"\n" \
"This day was only the first of many similar ones for the emancipated\n" \
"Mole, each of them longer and full of interest as the ripening summer\n" \
"moved onward. He learnt to swim and to row, and entered into the joy\n" \
"of running water; and with his ear to the reed-stems he caught, at\n" \
"intervals, something of what the wind went whispering so constantly\n" \
"among them.\n"
